# pass.in

This app was developed during the NLW Unite event, promoted by [Rocketseat](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/).

The **pass.in** is an application for **managing participants in in-person events**. The tool allows the organizer to register an event and open a public registration page. Registered participants can issue a credential for check-in on the day of the event. The system will scan the participant's credentials to allow entry to the event.
